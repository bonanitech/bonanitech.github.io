Until a few months ago, I was using [this method](https://bonani.tech/how-to-trigger-a-node-red-flow-from-the-home-assistant-ui/) to trigger a flow from the Home Assistant UI. Although it works fine, itâ€™s not very elegant. Empty scripts cause linting warnings, and we donâ€™t know if that will be forever supported by Home Assistant.

As [pointed out](https://bonani.tech/how-to-trigger-a-node-red-flow-from-the-home-assistant-ui/#comment-4794636679) by iantrich (a long time ago! ðŸ˜³) in the comments section of my old post, since version [0.20.0](https://github.com/zachowj/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/releases/tag/v0.20.0) of `node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket`, we can "Trigger an exposed event node from a service call".

> With the release of the Node-RED [custom component](https://github.com/zachowj/hass-node-red) version 0.3.0, it adds the ability to trigger an event node from a service call.

That makes triggering a Node-RED flow from the Home Assistant UI even easier.

First, in Node-RED, we need to add an `entity` node to the flow.

<br />

![entity-node](/assets/img/2020-10-31-entity-node.png)

<br />

Change its type to switch, and add a name in the Home Assistant Config section.

<br />

![edit-entity-node](/assets/img/2020-10-31-edit-entity-node.png)

<br />

Then we can connect our flow to the first output of the node.

<br />

![flow](/assets/img/2020-10-31-flow.png)

<br />

After that, in Home Assistant, we add the following code to a Lovelace view.

```yaml
- type: button
  entity: script.good_morning
  name: "Good Morning"
  icon: mdi:coffee
  tap_action:
    action: call-service
    service: nodered.trigger
    service_data:
      entity_id: switch.scene_good_morning
```

> `script.good_morning` is used here as the entity because I didnâ€™t want the button to change its color. That script was created using the code [below](#exposing-to-voice-assistants). If you don't want or don't need to use that script, you can use `switch.scene_good_morning` as the entity here.
{: .prompt-info }

<br />

This will create the button below.

<br />

![button](/assets/img/2019-07-14-button.png)

<br />

And when we press the button, it will trigger the flow we created above.

<br />

## Exposing to voice assistants

If we want to use our favorite voice assistant to trigger that flow, we can create a script.

```yaml
good_morning:
  alias: Good Morning
  sequence:
  - service: nodered.trigger
    data: {}
    entity_id: switch.scene_good_morning
  mode: single
```

And then we expose it using [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/) or other method.
